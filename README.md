## .vimrc for Back-end development

This repo is intended to backup, document and share my `.vimrc` file for Back-end development. The idea is to keep it simple, functional and maintenable.

This setup presuposes you are using [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage your _vim_ plugins, but you can use whatever fits your needs. In theory, you should have `vim` configured and ready to go in no time.

`.vimrc` configuration is a very subjective topic, but chances are you will find this one helpful as a starting point.
